# Enhanced App Detection Implementation

## What's New

### 1. **EnhancedAppDetectionService**
- Created a comprehensive detection service with multiple URL scheme variants for each app
- Covers 70+ popular apps including:
  - Chinese social media (WeChat, QQ, Weibo, Douyin, Xiaohongshu, etc.)
  - E-commerce (Taobao, JD, Pinduoduo, etc.)
  - Entertainment (Bilibili, iQiyi, Tencent Video, etc.)
  - International apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc.)
  - Games (Honor of Kings, PUBG Mobile, Genshin Impact, etc.)

### 2. **Multiple URL Scheme Variants**
- Many apps have multiple URL schemes that work
- The service tries all known variants to maximize detection
- Examples:
  - WeChat: `weixin`, `wechat`, `weixinULAPI`
  - Weibo: `sinaweibo`, `weibosdk`, `weibosdk2.5`
  - NetEase Cloud Music: `orpheus`, `orpheuswidget`
  - Douyin: `snssdk1128`, `douyinopensdk`

### 3. **URL Scheme Diagnostic Tool**
- Added "应用检测诊断" (App Detection Diagnostic) button
- Shows which apps are installed on your device
- Allows testing URL schemes and opening apps directly
- Can export detection results

### 4. **Updated Info.plist**
- Added new URL scheme variants to LSApplicationQueriesSchemes
- Still limited by iOS 50-scheme restriction
- Prioritized most popular apps

## How to Use

1. **Run Enhanced Detection**
   - Click "选择要锁定的应用" to see all detected apps
   - The system now uses EnhancedAppDetectionService automatically

2. **Diagnostic Tool**
   - Click "应用检测诊断" button
   - Run detection to see which apps are installed
   - Filter by category or show only installed apps
   - Export results for debugging

## Current Detection Results

From your logs, these apps are now detected:
- ✅ WeChat (微信)
- ✅ QQ
- ✅ Alipay (支付宝)
- ✅ Taobao (淘宝)
- ✅ Meituan (美团)
- ✅ DiDi (滴滴出行)
- ✅ JD (京东)
- ✅ QQ Music (QQ音乐)
- ✅ Pinduoduo (拼多多)
- ✅ WhatsApp
- ✅ YouTube
- ✅ Facebook
- ✅ Twitter
- ✅ Telegram
- ✅ LinkedIn
- ✅ Uber
- ✅ System apps (Mail, Phone, SMS, Safari, Maps, App Store)

## Apps Still Not Detected

These might not be installed on your device, or need different URL schemes:
- Douyin (抖音) - scheme is correct, app might not be installed
- Weibo (微博) - scheme is correct, app might not be installed
- Xiaohongshu (小红书) - scheme is correct, app might not be installed
- Bilibili - scheme is correct, app might not be installed
- Other apps...

## Next Steps

1. Use the diagnostic tool to check which URL schemes work on your device
2. If an app is installed but not detected, it might use a different URL scheme
3. You can test individual apps by trying to open their URLs directly
4. Report any apps that should be detected but aren't

## Technical Notes

- iOS limits apps to checking 50 URL schemes maximum
- URL schemes must be declared in Info.plist before use
- Some apps may change their URL schemes in updates
- System apps always work (mailto, tel, sms, http, maps, itms-apps)

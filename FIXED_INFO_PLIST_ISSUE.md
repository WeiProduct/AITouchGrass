# Fixed: Multiple Commands Produce Info.plist Error

## Problem
The build was failing with "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" error because:
1. The Info.plist file was inside the `AITouchGrass/` directory
2. With `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`, Xcode automatically adds all files in synchronized folders to appropriate build phases
3. Info.plist was being added to "Copy Bundle Resources" phase automatically
4. This conflicted with the "Process Info.plist" build phase

## Solution
1. Moved Info.plist from `AITouchGrass/Info.plist` to `./Info.plist` (project root)
2. Updated `project.pbxproj` to reference the new location:
   - Changed `INFOPLIST_FILE = AITouchGrass/Info.plist;` 
   - To `INFOPLIST_FILE = Info.plist;`

## Verification
✅ Build now succeeds
✅ LSApplicationQueriesSchemes is properly included in the compiled app
✅ All 49 URL schemes are present in the final Info.plist

## Next Steps
1. Clean the app from your iPhone completely
2. Build and run the app on your device
3. The app should now be able to detect third-party apps like WeChat, QQ, Alipay, etc.

## Important Notes
- The Info.plist must stay at the project root level
- Do not move it back into the AITouchGrass folder
- GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE remains set to NO as intended

## Application Information
- App Name: AITouchGrass
- Bundle ID: com.weiproduct.AITouchGrass
- Developer: [Your Name/Company]
- Contact Email: [Your Email]

## Executive Summary
AITouchGrass is an innovative digital wellness application that gamifies reducing screen time by requiring users to physically go outdoors and "touch grass" to unlock their restricted apps. Using advanced computer vision technology, the app verifies that users have genuinely engaged with nature before granting temporary access to their selected applications.

## Detailed Use Case

### Problem We're Solving
1. Excessive screen time affecting mental and physical health
2. Lack of outdoor activities, especially among young people
3. Difficulty in self-regulating app usage
4. Need for effective digital detox tools

### Our Solution
AITouchGrass creates a positive feedback loop:
1. Users voluntarily select apps they want to limit
2. These apps become inaccessible during restricted periods
3. To unlock, users must go outside and photograph nature
4. AI verifies the outdoor scene (grass, trees, sky)
5. Apps unlock temporarily, encouraging regular outdoor breaks

### Why Family Controls is Essential
Without Family Controls API:
- We can only send notifications (easily ignored)
- No real accountability or behavior change
- Users can simply dismiss reminders
- Limited effectiveness in helping users

With Family Controls API:
- Genuine app blocking creates real boundaries
- Users must take action (go outside) to regain access
- Measurable behavior change and outdoor time increase
- Aligns with Apple's digital wellness initiatives
